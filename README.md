![Healthcare Banner](https://i.imgur.com/example-banner.png) <!-- Replace with a relevant banner URL, you can create one on Canva -->

**Welcome to the Medical Test Results Prediction project. This repository is the capstone project for the "Deep Learning with Keras Python" course from BISA AI Academy. The primary objective is to build a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model capable of predicting a patient's medical test results (`Normal`, `Abnormal`, or `Inconclusive`) based on their demographic and clinical data.**

## üöÄ Project Background

In the digital age, healthcare data has become an invaluable asset. The ability to analyze and extract insights from medical records can significantly aid healthcare institutions in decision-making. This project serves as a case study for implementing Deep Learning to classify medical test outcomes. By predicting test results, this project aims to demonstrate the potential of AI in supporting clinical diagnostics.

## üìä Dataset

The project utilizes the **Healthcare Dataset (Synthetic)**, sourced from Kaggle.

*   **Source:** [Kaggle Healthcare Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset/data)
*   **Description:** This dataset contains 15 columns, including patient information such as age, gender, medical conditions, hospital admission details, and the target column `Test Results`.
*   **Total Records:** 55,500
*   **Key Features:** Age, Gender, Blood Type, Medical Condition, Admission Type, etc.
*   **Target Variable:** `Test Results` (A multi-class classification problem with three categories: `Normal`, `Abnormal`, `Inconclusive`)

## üß† Methodology

This project follows a systematic Data Science workflow:

1.  **Data Collection:** The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The data is analyzed and visualized to gain a deep understanding of patterns, distributions, and feature correlations.
3.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    *   Handling duplicate records.
    *   Dropping irrelevant columns (e.g., `Name`, `Doctor`).
    *   Performing feature engineering (e.g., calculating `Duration of Stay` from admission and discharge dates).
    *   Encoding categorical features (`One-Hot Encoding` or `Label Encoding`).
    *   Scaling numerical features using Normalization/Standardization.
4.  **Modeling:**
    *   Designing a Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture using the Keras API.
    *   Utilizing the `categorical_crossentropy` loss function and the Adam optimizer.
5.  **Training & Evaluation:**
    *   Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
    *   Training the model while monitoring its performance.
    *   Evaluating the model using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and a Confusion Matrix.
6.  **Conclusion:** Drawing conclusions from the model's performance and identifying potential areas for future improvement.
